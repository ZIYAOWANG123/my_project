## 1. [Tilegrams](https://github.com/PitchInteractiveInc/tilegrams) - `22/09/2016`

  * [Blog](http://pitchinteractive.com/latest/tilegrams-more-human-maps/)      
  * [Package Manual](https://github.com/PitchInteractiveInc/tilegrams/blob/master/MANUAL.md)

  * __Package Briefing__           
    * Mainly using data from US.       
    * With existing tilegrams:         
        1. Will provide some existing tilegrams for user exploration (US map). Users can export the SVG files and the [TopoJSON](https://github.com/topojson/topojson-specification/blob/master/README.md) into web application for customized display.      
        2. Moving tiles in single, a range or a specific region with highlight of each region on the sidebar area.     
        3. Users can remove or add a tile on the map.     
        4. The statistical accuracy of the display is summarized an indicator "delta". If it is positive, it represents the region has too many tiles than it should have, vice versa.

    * Generating new tilegrams:     
        1. Users can select from a few prepared data sets or input their own CSV (in a specified format using US FIPS codes). It will start from a conventional geographic map then resizing the regions to the selected data.     
        2. Users can adjust the number of value for each tile manually or using the `Resolution` slider.    
        * Need to alter the `delta` to `0` to make reasonable tilegrams for inferring.    

**_How does the computation of delta works?_**      

  - Calculated the proposed number of tiles of each region based on the population (`500,000 per tile`), then compute the difference between the data sets to obtain `delta` value.
